My personal resume website.

Feel free to use as a starting place for your own site.

## Requirements

It's recommended to install gulp-cli before trying to build this site.

```bash
npm install -g gulp-cli
```

## Installation

Building the website is simple. Just run:

```bash
npm install
gulp
```

To enter develoment mode, use:

```bash
gulp dev
```

This will do the following:

1. Build the static files from the templates.

1. Watch those files for changes.

1. Start a server running on localhost:8000 to serve the newly created files.

1. Open the webpage in your default browser.
