My personal resume website.

Feel free to use as a starting place for your own site.

## Installation

Building the website is simple. Just run:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

To enter develoment mode, use:

```bash
npm run open
```

This will do the following:

1. Build the static files from the templates.

1. Start an http-server to serve the newly created files.

1. Open the webpage in your default browser.
